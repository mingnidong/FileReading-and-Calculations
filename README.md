# FileReading-and-Calculations
Worked on for Penn Electric Racing: This tool parses CSV-like files, extracts data, and performs calculations. It determines the car's minimum, maximum, and average speed (MPH) during the race. It calculates power consumption at each point using current and voltage, and applies numerical integration to find the total energy consumed during the run.
